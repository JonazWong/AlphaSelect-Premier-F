# 🎊 YOU FOUND THE PROBLEM & IT'S FIXED!

## What Happened

You discovered you were using the **OLD folder** path.

**This is EXCELLENT detective work!** 👍

Now everything is fixed and ready to deploy.

---

## The Solution

### Old Path (❌ Wrong - Don't Use!)
```
E:\AlphaSelect-Suite-Perimer-AlphaSelect-Premier-F
```

### New Path (✅ Correct - Use This!)
```
E:\AlphaSelect-Suite-Perimer\AlphaSelect-Premier-F
```

**The difference:** Space and backslash, not hyphen!

---

## ✅ Verified

I checked your current folder and confirmed:

```
✓ .do/app.yaml exists
✓ backend/Dockerfile exists
✓ frontend/Dockerfile exists
✓ docker-compose.yml exists
✓ .github/workflows/ exists (5 workflows)
✓ All documentation files exist
```

**Everything is in the CORRECT folder!**
